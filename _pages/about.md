What comes to mind when you think of the Rhetoric of Science and Technology? Most scholars might conjure up ideas about rhetoricians such as Bazerman, Berkenkotter, Fahnestock, Gross, Miller, or Pender to name a few. Perhaps, you know how these rhetoricians disciplinized and applied rhetorical theory to understand rhetorical work of scientific discourse and its knowledge claims. What remains a bit more nebulous, however, is how rhetoricians theorize and study the rhetorics of technology.

In this course, students will both study and apply developing bodies of rhetorical approaches to theorizing the rhetorics of technology that include, but extend beyond, the linguistic-textual. To accomplish this goal, students will first read and discuss rhetorical theories that have been integrated with that of mediation, activity, feminist, queer, and race. Graded projects will include weekly writings during the first half of the course as a way to work through this survey of scholarship. Additionally, these weekly writings will help each student work toward the construction of their own rhetorical methodology. In the second half of the course, students will apply these methodologies in a small-scale autoethnography about their own rhetorical experiences with a particular technology. Students will come away from the course with the following: 1) knowledge about emerging methodologies in rhetorics of technology, 2) a pilot of their own methodology, and 3) insight into their own rhetorical experiences with a networked technology. PhD students will also be required to write a reflection about their methodology for future use.
